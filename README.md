## Git Commands
Working With Local Repositories
-  <b>git init</b>
	- The command git init is used to create an empty Git repository. 
After the git init command is used, a .git folder is created in the directory with some subdirectories. Once the repository is initialized, the process of creating other files begins.</p>

-  <b>git add</b>
	- Add command is used after checking the status of the files, to add those files to the staging area.
Before running the commit command, "git add" is used to add any new or modified files.

- <b>git commit</b>
	- The commit command makes sure that the changes are saved to the local repository.
The command "git commit â€“m <message>" allows you to describe everyone and help them understand what has happened.

- <b>git status</b>
	- The git status command tells the current state of the repository.
	- The command provides the current working branch. If the files are in the staging area, but not committed, it will be shown by the git status. Also, if there are no changes, it will show the message no changes to commit, working directory clean.

- <b>git config</b>
	- The git config command is used initially to configure the user.name and user.email. This specifies what email id and username will be used from a local repository.
When git config is used with --global flag, it writes the settings to all repositories on the computer.


- <b>git branch</b>
	- The git branch command is used to determine what branch the local repository is on.
The command enables adding and deleting a branch.


- <b> git checkout</b>

	- The command works on three separate entities: files, commits, and branches.

-  <b>git merge</b>
	- The git merge command is used to integrate the branches together. The command combines the changes from one branch to another branch. 
	- It is used to merge the changes in the staging branch to the stable branch.


## Git Commands: Working With Remote Repositories

- git remote

The command downloads the remote repository to the computer. It is equivalent to the Git init command when working with a remote repository.

-  git pull 
	- The git pull command is used to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to the local repository.
	- The command "git pull origin master" copies all the files from the master branch of the remote repository to the local repository.

- git push
	- The command git push is used to transfer the commits or pushing the content from the local repository to the remote repository.
	- The command is used after a local repository has been modified, and the modifications are to be shared with the remote team members.

- git log
	- The git log command shows the order of the commit history for a repository.
	- The command helps in understanding the state of the current branch by showing the commits that lead to this state.
